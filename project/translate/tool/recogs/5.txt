Mutating webhook(Kubernetes v1.9.0+)
CMK makes use of mutating admission webhook to simplify deployment of workloads
Whenever a user tries to create a pod which definition contains any container requesting CMK Extended Resources or has
cmk.intel. com/mutate: "true"annotation, CMK webhook modifies it by applying a number of modifications on top of the
original pod spec, including
CMK installation and configuration directories and host /proc filesystem volumes,
CMK service account
tolerations required for the pod to be scheduled on the cmk enabled node
annotation to mark pod as modified
Containers which are part of the pod specification are updated with
environmental variable CMK_NUM_CORES with its value set to the number of cores specified in the Extended Resource
t/imit(if present),
volume mounts (referencing volumes added to the pod),
environmental variable CMK PRoc Fs
