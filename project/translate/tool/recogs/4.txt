Requirements
1. Provide exclusive access to one or more physical cores for a given user containers
2. Provide shared access to pools of physical cores for groups of user containers
3. Provide a form of cooperative thread-level Cpu affinity: allow some of a container's threads to run in the
infrasctructure pool while other high priority threads(e. g userspace poll-mode driver) run on exclusively allocated
cores
4. Run on unmodified kubernetes releases
Supported Kubernetes versions: v1.5.x, v1.6.x
5. Allow the cmk tools to be mounted from the host filesystem so that users do not need to include the tools inside
every user container
6. Interoperate well with the isolcpus kernel parameter When initializing the CMK configuration directory, prefer to
align exclusive CPU lists with fully-isolated physical cores
7. Provide sufficient observability tooling to quickly assess the current configuration and health status of the CMK
system
