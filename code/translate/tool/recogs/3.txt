1 INTRODUCTION
Deep Packet Inspection (DPD is a technique that allows fine-grained real-time monitoring of flows
and users activity in networks and IT systems. It processes network packets to examine the data part
(and possibly also the header) of a packet flow, identifying traffic types and searching for protocol
non-compliance, viruses, spam, intrusions or any other specified signature dPi is a key enabler of
traffic management, especially to deal with the quality of service of multimedia traffic and to deliver
security services Infonetics report that the dpi market is forecast to grow at a 22% rate from 2013 to
2018 driven in particular by the video traffic growth in Asian markets and in lte deployments [1]
Originally implemented as hardware middleboxes to be installed in network infrastructures
DPI appliances are evolving towards the network functions virtualization (NFV) paradigm: they are
being virtualized and delivered as software bundles that can be deployed and used on demand and
on commodity hardware platforms. This approach is strongly supported by ISPs at ETSI [2] to build
NFV infrastructures, which basically consist of cloud platforms that can run software network
functions. These infrastructures are intended to be deployed at Points of Presence(POs)or local aggre
gation points in carrier networks. Network functions are delivered as optimized software that fully
benefit from standard x86 multi-core processor architectures to process packets and that can run into
