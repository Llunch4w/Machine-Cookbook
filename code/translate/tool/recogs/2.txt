SUMMARY
Network functions virtualization (NFV) is transforming how networks are operated and how network
services are delivered. The network is more flexible and adaptable and it can scale with traffic demands
To manage video traffic in the network, or acquire protection from cyber-attacks, Deep Packet Inspection
DPD) is increasingly deployed at specific locations in the network. The virtual DPI (VDPI)engines can be
dynamically deployed as software on commodity servers within emerging network functions virtualization
infrastructures. For a network operator, deploying a set of vdPls over the network is a matter of finding the
appropriate placement that meets the traffic management or cyber-security targets(such as the number of
inspected flows) and operational cost constraints (licence fees, network efficiency or power consumption)
In this work, we formulate the vdPI placement problem as a cost minimization problem. The cost captures
the different objectives that the operator is pursuing. A placement of vDPIs on the network nodes realizes a
trade-off between these possibly conflicting goals. We cast the problem as a multi-commodity flow problem
and solve it as an integer linear program. We then devise a centrality-based greedy algorithm and assess
its validity by comparing it with the integer linear program optimal solution on a real dataset (GEANT
network with 22 nodes and real traffic matrix ). We further analyse the scalability of the heuristic by
applying it to larger random networks of up to 300 nodes. The results show the network structure and the
costs influence time performance. Finally, they demonstrate that the heuristic approximates the optimal on
small and medium problem instances well. Copyright o 2015 John Wiley sons, Ltd
