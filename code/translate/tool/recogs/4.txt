virtualized machines. A large variety of products already exist for firewalling, caching, ciphering or
load balancing, in both mobile and fixed networks Software implementations of network functions
are particularly relevant for DPi because this function is highly dependent on the traffic dynamics
and may require additional computational resources on demand dPi market leaders such as sandvine
offer a virtual version of their products with the same functionality and features as the physical ones
Virtualizing network functions enables to rapidly scale up(or down) services, as this only requires the
installation or activation of virtual functions on existing server equipment
