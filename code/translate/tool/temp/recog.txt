Now suppose that writing every bit of the output to memory counts as an operation that
we wish to account for in our running-time analysis (in the previous part, we disregard the
time required to write the output to memory). Can you compute Fn in time that is bounded
by a polynomial in the size of the input? Justify your answer.
